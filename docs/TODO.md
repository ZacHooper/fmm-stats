# TODO — the one doc you read to resume

**Where the project is, and everything still open.** There is no second resume doc: if it
isn't here, it isn't outstanding. The other files in `docs/` are *reference* — record layouts,
rules, dead ends already measured — and you read them when a task sends you there, not to find
out what to do.

If you finish something, **delete its entry**. Do not tick it off, or this rots into a
changelog, which is what killed the last four handoff docs.

Item numbers are for conversation only — they are renumbered whenever entries are deleted, so
never cite one in code or a commit message.

Last reviewed **2026-09-17**, after PR #51 (record expansion + attribute decoder rebuild).

## Where the project is

Reverse-engineering **Football Manager Mobile 2022** `.fms` saves into a DuckDB store, a static
web app and a Streamlit dashboard, to manage a career with real data.

| | |
|---|---|
| career | **Boldklubben Frem** (Denmark, `--career frem`, managed tid 346, reserves 7296) |
| store | **25 snapshots**, `fm-frem.duckdb`, latest **2027 / 2026-07-02** |
| division | **3F Superliga — tier 1, `club_league` cid 2 — since season 2025** |
| how they got there | 3. Division → 2. Division → NordicBet Liga → Superliga, three straight promotions |
| tactic | `frem_attacking_ss` (strikerless SS), the dashboard default |
| hold-out | **Bucaspor** (Turkey) is archived, and is the only cross-career parser regression test |

The squad was built to win the fourth tier. Expect the level gap to be the dominant story.

**Infrastructure is done and not a source of open work.** Storage tiers (git / R2 / local-only)
are settled, the store is disposable (`scripts/rebuild.py --career frem`), the web app is live
at <https://fmm-stats.zac-g-hooper.workers.dev>, remote-agent SQL over R2 works, and squad
registration shipped. House rules live in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — read them there, they
are not repeated here.

### Reading the data without getting it wrong

Five things have produced numbers that looked fine and were not. All are live traps, not history:

- **Score an attribute on the population that HAS it.** A keeper attribute sits at the display
  floor for an outfielder, so pooling made Communication read 92.4% when it scores 3.0% on
  actual keepers.
- **The decoder's ceiling is 94.8% exact / 98.7% ±1, not 100%** — measured on attributes read
  straight from a byte, where a disagreement is the two sources disagreeing rather than a decode
  error ([`ca-weighting.md`](ca-weighting.md)). Quote accuracy against that, never against 100%.
  Current state: **59.4% exact on Frem, 59.5% on the Bucaspor hold-out**, for the nine outfield
  entangled attributes; frozen was 46.3%.
- **Joining a per-(season, _phase_) dimension on (season, club_tid) fans every fact out by the
  snapshot count.** Frem's 19 home games read as 95.
- **`any_value(x ORDER BY y)` does not order in DuckDB.** `max_by(x, y)` is the one that works.
- **`mart.club_attendance` is our-matches-only** — every club but us has one or two home games a
  season, so read `n_games` before trusting `avg_att`. (`staging.club_details.att_*` is NOT
  attendance — see below.)

### Where to look

## Blocked / needs a decision from Zac

### 1. The R2 API token has never been rolled
Its access key and secret were pasted into a chat transcript. Cloudflare → R2 → Manage API
Tokens, then `rclone config update r2 access_key_id <NEW> secret_access_key <NEW>`. **This is
the only security item in this file.**

### 2. `mart.squad_current` still uses the spell model
`roster_vs_spells` exists specifically to judge whether to switch it to the roster. Nobody has
read it and decided. Until then the spell model stands, because it is the one that survives a
lapsed loan (a departed player's `club_tid` can point at us indefinitely).

---

## Parser / decode

### 3. The league standings record is decoded but not implemented
`staging.standings` still reads `source = 'lightresults_computed'` — the *approximate* table
inferred from partial fixture coverage. A **14-byte fixed record holding the exact final
position of every club in every loaded competition** was decoded on 2026-07-20 and never wired
up. Layout, validation and parser plan: [`standings-record.md`](standings-record.md). Strict
upgrade over what ships today.

### 4. Complete results/fixtures via a date search
**Re-scoped 2026-09-17.** The light-results region turned out to be the **club records**
tables (`fmparser/clubrecords.py`), so the complete results are not there and never were, and
neither the rolling-buffer story nor the "partial decode" framing survives. 28 results read
off in-game screenshots (`tests/fixtures/light_results_truth.json`) are recovered 9/28, and
those 9 are precisely the ones that happen to BE club records. Two fixtures
(Southampton 3-0 Aston Villa, Liverpool 0-1 Newcastle) have their two club tids nowhere
adjacent in the file, so any remaining structure does not store a fixture as a tid pair.
**Updated 2026-09-17 (second pass).** The "cid-less list at ~49.36 MB" **does not exist** —
it is an unset table, every field `0xff`. Six more hypotheses were tested and killed with
measurements (uid-keyed records, slot-index round-robin columns, bare score arrays, the
datadict's `fxds`/`mtdy` scheduling records, a two-save append diff); all are tabulated in
[`light-results-record.md`](light-results-record.md) so they are not re-run.

**The 25-byte AWAY-FIRST record is now DECODED as far as its shape goes** —
`fmparser/matchslots.py`, guarded by `tests/test_match_slots.py`. Stride 25 (two independent
measurements), self-locating by a constant at +20, **3,975 slots on every Frem save across four
seasons and 3,943 on Bucaspor** (a preallocated table, which is the invariant that bounds the
walk), all 25 bytes named or declared UNKNOWN, and three fixtures verified against the game.

**It is NOT the fixture list**: 275 matches from many leagues at once, recovering 2 of the 28
screenshot fixtures, with 3,700 further slots carrying a trailer and a date but no match. What
the table is FOR is still unknown — 13 of its 25 bytes are carried, not named, and four of them
are known to hold only three independent numbers. Naming those, or finding what selects the
275, is the next question.

Still unexamined: a 497-record chained region at 6.127-6.260 MB that `find_light_regions`
never sweeps.

[`date-search.md`](date-search.md) — the results we hold are **our matches only**, confirmed by
`mart.competitions`: we carry exactly **32** Superliga fixtures per season, which is one club's
full league programme, not the division's ~200. Two zones that light up on a date search
(~36–38 MB, ~63–64 MB) have never been examined.

**Possibly superseded by #3**: if the standings record gives exact final tables, complete
fixtures may no longer be needed. Decide that before spending time here.

### 5. `att_avg` / `att_min` / `att_max` are misnamed — curiosity only
The bytes are read correctly (`league_id` lands exactly at p+158 right beside them), but the
NAMES come from fmm-editor's `Club.cs` and were never checked against the game. They fail every
check: a hard worldwide ceiling of 12,500 with 99 clubs exactly on it; always multiples of 100,
only 66 distinct values of `att_avg` worldwide; and **Barcelona reads max 9,500 BELOW avg
9,600**, which no genuine min/avg/max triple can do (6.8% of clubs violate the ordering). No
single scale reconciles them with in-game figures — ×10 matches Frem's ~11k exactly but gives
FCK 36k against an in-game ~30k and puts 25% of clubs above their own stadium capacity.

**Deliberately NOT surfaced in `mart.clubs`**; carried in `staging.club_details` only.

**Superseded in practice.** `staging.matches.attendance` is the real figure and is exposed as
`mart.club_attendance`: FCK 32,875 against a reported ~30k, Frem climbing 2,086 (2022, lower
divisions) → 10,924 (2026, Superliga) against Zac's ~11k. Capacity correlates **+0.93** with it;
`att_avg` correlates **−0.31**. So this is now curiosity, and low priority. If anyone picks it
up, the method is ground truth rather than more inference (CLAUDE.md §3), and note they are NOT
static as first claimed: 506 of 5,208 clubs move `att_avg` across snapshots — Frem and FCK just
happen not to.

### 6. One match-event type byte is unnamed
`?0e` (byte 14): 2 events, both in reserve fixtures, minutes 38 and 59. `mart.match_events`
carries it verbatim rather than dropping it. `0x07`/`0x08` were named `shootout_goal` /
`shootout_miss` on 2026-09-17 — see `fmparser/matches.py` for the arithmetic that settled the
direction.

### 7. Staff record: five catalog indices plus six hidden attributes
Bytes `+34..+38` are five undecoded catalog indices, declared `UNKNOWN` in
`scripts/audit_records.py`'s `LAYOUTS` so the audit passes honestly. The record's stride and
coverage are proven; only these are unnamed.

The six hidden staff attributes stay named by OFFSET (`hidden_s18 … hidden_s28`) on purpose:
fmm-editor has **no `Staff.cs`** — its `People.cs` stops at the `Unknown6b` u32 that links here
— so there is no upstream order to borrow and no ground truth of our own. **`hidden_s27` is the
one to identify next**: 85% of staff read 1–4 against ~10 for the other five, the only one
distinctive enough for a small ground-truth set.

### 8. 17% of origin clubs do not resolve, and the capital rule silently under-reports
**3,936 of 22,624** origin clubs come back as `#<tid>` in `mart.player_origin.origin_club`, so
the capital-province rule **cannot be evaluated** for that share of the pool — and
`eligible=False` is currently indistinguishable from *unknown*. Confirmed live: Samuel
Clemmensen (tid 8834) read `#65192`; Zac identified it in-game as FC Fredericia (genuinely
ineligible), but the data could not say so. These ids are **not** in `staging.clubs`, so they
are probably youth/academy or defunct-club records in another structure.

Two things to do: find where they resolve, and until then make `player_origin` distinguish
*ineligible* from *unknown*. **Treat `eligible=False` on a `#<tid>` origin as "ask Zac", not
"no".**

### 9. Three records still read short or unread
All three are known gaps, not suspicions:

- **`parse_club_trailer` steps over 20 undecoded bytes** — width confirmed, content unread.
- **The Region table is unparsed**, as is the nation record's counted language list.
- **`_nation_candidates` breaks its `nat_len` loop unconditionally**, dropping a candidate whose
  `name_len` search then fails. It does not bite on the current saves, which is why it survived.

### 10. `mart.club_managers` isn't purely structural
It keeps a `home_reputation` tiebreak and exposes no candidate count, so a sole structural hit
and a reputation fallback are indistinguishable to anything reading the view. A scout report
quoting the opposition manager cannot tell how confident to be.

---

## Models

### 11. Refit the transfer-value model with the new reputation fields
`current_reputation` and `world_reputation` are parsed (PR #51) and currently unused —
`fmparser/value_model.py` still fits on `reputation` alone. This was the one workstream from the
parser expansion that never got done, and reputation is exactly what a value model wants. Zac
called it out as important for transfer value.

### 12. Attribute decoder — two measured leads, and two hints
Both leads are from [`attribute-model.md`](attribute-model.md); neither is speculative.

- **Bias is almost the whole story.** `|mean signed error|` correlates **−0.91** with the
  exact-match rate across the 14. The misses are systematic, not noisy — an intercept problem,
  which is the most fixable kind.
- **We under-predict good players.** Exact falls 83.6% (true 4–6) → 22.4% (true 16–20) with the
  bias going +0.10 → −1.01. Worst precisely where scouting cares most.

Two features that lost at n=80 but lost *narrowly*, worth one re-test now the store is 25
snapshots: **feet for Dribbling** (48→54%) and **height/weight for Shooting** (63→66%).

**Read the reference doc's "already ruled out" section first** — height, the CA constraint, the
CA surprise, a non-linear link and `blend_w` are all tested and dead. Do not re-run them.

### 13. Goalkeeper attributes cannot be modelled at this sample size
Frem has **7 goalkeepers**. The five keeper attributes are deliberately **not refitted**
(`--min-players`, default 20) and keep the frozen coefficients, because refitting made the
Bucaspor hold-out worse. Needs more GK ground truth before it can move — which realistically
means more careers, not more snapshots (the learning curve is flat in rows and only bends in
players).

---

## Quality

### 14. Every test skips silently and exits 0 without a save
So a clean clone runs the suite, sees green, and has tested nothing. The suite is save-dependent
by nature; the fix is to make absence *fail loudly* or report SKIPPED in a way CI can count, not
to pretend it passed.

---

## Football (the actual career)

### 15. Position write-ups still owed
Zac asked for the position-by-position read for **DM, CM, AML, AMC, AMR and ST**, plus a verdict
on the **4-1-2-2-1** question. GK/LB/RB/CB were delivered. **The earlier analysis is several
seasons stale** — it was written when Frem were in NordicBet Liga; they have been in the **3F
Superliga (tier 1, cid 2) since 2025** and the store now runs to **2027 / 2026-07-02**. Redo the
read against the current squad rather than resuming the old one.

---

## Housekeeping (safe to do any time)

- **~308 MB of stale `output/` dirs** from old experiments (`frem-patched-test`,
  `multi-region-test`, `frem-22-start`, pre-rename leftovers). All regenerable.
  Careful: `rebuild.py --skip-existing` reuses these, and a stale-FORMAT extract used to load
  silently — now guarded by `_extract_is_current`, but deleting them is still tidier.
- **`~/fm-parser-git-backup-20260820.tar`** (302 MB) and `/tmp/oldgit` — the pre-history-rewrite
  backup, safe to delete now the rebuild is verified.
- **4 saves in `unfiled/`** with no in-game date, so no canonical name:
  `frem/unfiled/denmark-mid-22.fms`, `bucaspor/unfiled/{22-23-start, fm_save1-24-mid,
  fm_save3}.fms`. Needs Zac's in-game dates to file them.
- **`careers.py` hardcodes `reserve_tid`** — `main_club_tid` from the club record could replace
  it, making a new career one field shorter to register.
- **Stale commit SHAs** cited in `agent-context/fm-parser-project.md` and
  `day1-league-membership.md` (`aac6cbe`, `0b9a679`, `9c89633`, `d0f60af`) — invalidated by the
  history rewrite. Cosmetic.
- **The Cloudflare Pages project does not exist** — the site is deployed as a Worker instead
  (see [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md)). Preview locally with `uv run python -m http.server -d site 8000`.
